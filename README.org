* Database Modelling

In this project, a PostgreSQL database will be used. After modelling
the database structure, aiming to fit the desired endpoints results
and parameters, we start to setup the database.

[[./database/model/database.png]]

After [[https://www.postgresql.org/download/][downloading and installing]] Postgres, it is necessary to create
the database, running the following sql command (using pgAdmin or
psql):

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
CREATE DATABASE challenge;
#+END_SRC

Next, it is necessary to connect to the database, by running =\c
challenge= on psql, so the script may alter this specific
database. The documentation on the implementation of the script can be
found at [[file:database/scripts/][database/scripts/]], I encourage the reader to check the
=README.org= file. Thus, the tables are created by running [[file:database/scripts/table_creation.sql][this script]]
and they are populated by running [[file:database/scripts/tables_insertions.sql][this other script]].

And add the lisp user:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
CREATE USER lisp WITH PASSWORD 'lisp';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO lisp;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO lisp;
#+END_SRC

* Back-end Server

Next, it is necessary to have Common Lisp installed, along with
=quicklisp=, to manage packages. This can be easily done by
downloading [[https://portacle.github.io][Portacle]] and cloning this repository into the
=local-projects= folder, inside =portacle/quicklisp/=.

After done, it is necessary to execute Portacle, open Slime (by
pressing Alt+X and typing =slime=) and run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(ql:quickload :back-end)
#+END_SRC

This will download and install every dependency of the project. The
implementation process of this step is documented in [[file:server/][server/]].

Execute this command to get the server up and running (on port 9003): 

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(clack:clackup (make-clack-app) :port 9003)
#+END_SRC
